  <h3><strong><span class="span">About me:</span></strong></h3>

  <p>I was born in Porltand, OR and later relocated to Gresham, OR. After spending most of my childhood in Oregon we moved up to Vancouver, WA where I attended high school and went on to attend Eastern Washington University. After my venture out east, I moved back to Vancouver and started working in the food service industry. I spent nearly the next 15 years working in kitchens and worked my way up through the ranks to eventually become Food Service Director. While I loved my time spent in kitchens I decided it was time to step back and take another direction. I took some time off "life" to travel around the country and actually enjoy life. All good things must come to an end. I applied to become a heavy equipment operator through Local 701. I was accepted by the union and spent some time as an apprentice operator and while playing in the dirt is fun, being away from life, family, and friends is not. After some time I decided that constantly being on the road was not for me. I stepped back again and decided to move in another direction. I found myself working for Waste Connections driving Class B CDL vehicles and simultaneously working for my local home brew supply store. That brings me to my current state of life. I have always had an interest in computers and spent a little time prior to joining <span class="span">Epicodus</span> taking free online tutorials and trying to teach myself. I realized I need a more structured enviroment and a "starting point" as I found myself all over the place with no real idea where to actually start. With a nudge from my significant other and her parents they convinced me to go for it. Her parents are both retired programmers and were the biggest influence on me joining <span class="span">Epicodus.</span></p>
